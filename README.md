# Friend Finder - A Compatibility App Using Node and Express

### Overview

For this project, we had to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application/ a basic dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from user surveys, then compares answers with those from other users for compatibility. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

We used Express to handle routing and Heroku for deployment.
